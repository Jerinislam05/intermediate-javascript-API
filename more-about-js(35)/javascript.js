// what is javascript?
/* 
1. Javascript is highly abstracted programming language. [High abstraction means => hiding the implementation details, showing only functionality to the users, memory allocation, garbage collection, understandability and maintainability]

2. Javascript is a JIT(Just-In-Time) compiled language. [JIT means => Just-In-Time compiler converts the entire code into machine code and execute them immediately]

3. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language.[Paradigm means => code structure that will determine the style or a way of programming. For example, procedural programming(past), object-oriented programming(nowadays), functional programming]

4. JavaScript is a proto-type based programming language. [proto-type means => everything is object except the primitive data. A proto-type object is an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object. Proto-type is a blue print]

5. JavaScript is dynamically typed


** JavaScript is a JIT compiled, multi-paradigm, prototype-based, dynamically typed, high abstracted programming language.
